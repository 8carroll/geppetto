<p>Geppetto 1.0.0 has been released and is available for download.</p>
<p>If you haven't been following the Geppetto Project, Geppetto is an integrated toolset for working with Puppet modules and manifests. It's built on the Eclipse platform. If you're an Eclipse user, you can install it directly into your IDE. If you're not, it's also available as ready-to-run .zip's with a much smaller footprint than the full Eclipse.</p>

<p>Although we're calling it "1.0.0", Geppetto is is probably more mature than many 1.x releases, and we have invested quite a bit of time into it over the last six months. (Actually, it didn't come out of nowhere; it builds on work we've done in other domains over the last several years.) We released the first beta at FOSDEM 2011 in Brussels in early February, and got lots of really useful feedback there and at PuppetCamp Amsterdam in April.</p>

<p>Finally, thanks to everyone who's offered help and encouragement along the way, with a special shout-out to the people at Puppet Labs.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of what's supported in the release:</p>
