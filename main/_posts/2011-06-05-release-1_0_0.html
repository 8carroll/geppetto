<p>We are proud to announce that Geppetto 1.0.0 has been released and is available for download. 
</p>
<p>In case you are reading this and do not already know what Geppetto is about - Geppetto is an 
integrated set of tools for consuming and developing Puppet modules and manifests built on the
Eclipse platform. It is available as ready to run zips (with a much smaller footprint than the full
Eclipse), or it can be installed into your Eclipse IDE.</p>

<p>A lot of things have happened since the first beta was made available at Fosdem 2011 (Feb 5-6), Bruxelles, Belgium, when a group of beta testers started trying out Geppetto. We have received valueable
feedback from users at the 2011 PuppetCamp in Amsterdam, Netherlands, as well as from Puppetlabs, and
thanks to everyone that has taken time testing, reporting and discussing issues, we now
feel we have a 1.0 product. The feeback is always welcome.
</p>
<p>Rather than dwelling on what has happened, instead lets look at the features available in Geppetto
1.0:</p>
