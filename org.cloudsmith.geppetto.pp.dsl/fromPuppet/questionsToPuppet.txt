A NodeDefinition can inherit from something. In the grammar this is specified as HostName which expands
to expected names, but also regular expression. Is this correct?

What is the expected handling of hex, octal, float values - it seems like this clash with names. Is the definition
that if something is a reference to something named like an hex octal or float that the named reference has higher
precedence?

Since function can be called without parenthesis around the arguments, is parsing depending on knowing all external
functions? If so, do they have to be imported (or it seems impossible to verify the correctness of certain expressions
without a runtime).
