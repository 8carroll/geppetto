The project has three near-term objectives:

1. flatten the learning curve associated with using the Puppet DSL to create manifests,
1. support Puppet best practices for working with manifests in the form of modules, and
1. encourage sharing of modules within the community using the Puppet Forge.

A longer-term objective will be to make it easier for a wider range of tools to interoperate with Puppet
by using Geppetto's modeling foundation as a means of interchange; potential synergies with
the new p(0) project (http://github.com/lak/pzero) will be explored for this purpose.
