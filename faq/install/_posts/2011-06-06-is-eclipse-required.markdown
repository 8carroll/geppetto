title: Is Eclipse Required?
---
Geppetto is based on Eclipse, but you do not need a full Eclipse to use Geppetto.
The 'ready to run' packages provided on Geppetto Downloads contain a suitable set of plugins
when working with puppet development, and is much smaller than the standard Eclipse distribution.

When you download one of the Geppetto packages, you do not need to install anything else.
