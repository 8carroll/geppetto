title: How can I install DLTK for Ruby?
---
If you want to add support for editing ruby files in Geppetto, you can install
the Eclipse DLTK/Ruby into Geppetto. There is however no support for erb files

To install:

- Select Help > Install new Software
- Add the URL http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dltk/updates/
- Select, the apropriate DLTK version (currently 2.0), and select Ruby
- Click throught the wizard and accept the license
- You are warned about unsigned content, accept that
- When prompted to restart, do so
- Create a Ruby project (helps you configure a ruby runtime)
- Ruby files can now be edited with syntax coloring etc.
