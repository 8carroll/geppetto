title: How can I update Geppetto?
---
Updating Geppetto is easy, simply do this:

- Select `Help` > `Check for Updates`
- When a list of things to update is shown, select the `Uncategorized` feature
  from the Geppetto update site (most likely the only thing displayed, and yes
  we know we need to fix the name of this category).
- Click through the license
- When prompted to restart, do so
